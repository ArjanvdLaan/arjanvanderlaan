            The Lord of the Rings is an epic fantasy story told by J.R.R. Tolkien. 
            Written between 1937 - 1949, much of it was done during the second world war. <br>
            It was meant as a sequel to Tolkien's children's book The Hobbit. 
            The lord of the Rings is one of the best selling books ever written, <br>
            it has been translated into at least 38 languages. 
            In shaping the modern fantasy genre, it is considered as one of the greatest books ever written. <br>
            The story consists of three main parts: The Fellowship of the Ring, 
            The Two Towers and The Return of the King.

            <h1 id="Series">The (upcoming) series</h1>
            <p> Set in the Second Age of Middle-earth, thousands of years before the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, 
                the series follows an ensemble cast of characters as they confront the re-emergence of evil in Middle-earth.<br>
                
                In July 2017, a lawsuit was settled between Warner Bros., the company behind the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit film trilogies, and the Tolkien Estate, 
                the estate of author J. R. R. Tolkien upon whose books those films were based. With the two sides "on better terms" following the settlement, 
                they began shopping a potential television series based on Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings books to several outlets, including Amazon, Netflix, and HBO. 
                By September, Amazon had emerged as the frontrunner and entered negotiations for the series. 
                In an uncommon move for programming developments at the studio, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was personally involved with the negotiations.
                Bezos had previously given Amazon Studios a mandate to develop a fantasy series of comparable scale to HBO's Game of Thrones, 
                which had made Amazon the lead contender for the project. <br>
                
                Prime Video gave the series a multi-season commitment, believed to be for five seasons, as part of the initial deal with the Tolkien Estate,
                though the streaming service still had to give a formal greenlight to future seasons before work could begin on them.
                Pre-production for the second season is expected to begin in the UK in the second quarter of 2022, 
                taking place concurrently with post-production for the first season which is continuing in New Zealand until June 2022</p>
